#Image-Mapper

Playing around with various ways to achieve the same image-mapping tool.

Initialize hotspot by clicking anywhere on the image.  Click on another location over the image to initialize your second coordinate and begin drawing a path connecting them.  When you are done with your polygonal shape you can double click to finish path and begin a new one.


###TODO

- ~~Multiple paths~~
- ~~Stroke Paths (draw line)~~
- Customizable paths (line color)
- Separate arrays of new paths (store them individually)
- ~~Begin implementing input feature~~
- ~~Work on designing input UI~~
- Lift site off static GH Pages and onto Heroku or something
